Hello world.

I'm very excited to start digging into code here on GitHub! I'm a 23 year old college graduate living in Duluth, Minnesota. 
I studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota. I enjoy many things including music, technology, and nature. 
I have aspirations of building great software, meeting great people, and learning from and contibuting to this wonderful community!
